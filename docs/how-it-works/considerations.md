## Important Considerations

!!! info "Assumptions"
    *   [x] **AWS Regions:** Multi Region setup â†’ 1ry: us-east-1 (N. Virginia) & 2ry: us-west-2 (Oregon).
        DevOps necessary repositories will be created. There will be feature branches (`ID-XXX` -> `master`) and either
        Binbash or the Client Engineers will be reviewers of each other and approvers (at least 1 approver).
    *   [x] After deployment via IaC (Terraform, Ansible & Helm) all subsequent changes will be performed via versioned
        controlled code, by modifying the corresponding repository and running the proper IaC Automation execution. 
        Will start the process via Local Workstations. Afterwards full exec automation will be considered via: Jenkins, 
        CircleCI or Terraform Cloud Jobs (GitOps). 
        - :ledger: **Consideration:** Note that any change manually performed will generate inconsistencies on the deployed resources 
          (which left them out of governance and support scope).
    *   [x] All AWS resources will be deployed via **_Terraform_** and rarely occasional CloudFormation, Python SDK & AWS CLI
        when the resource is not defined by Terraform (almost none scenario). All code and scripts will be included in the 
        repository.
    *   [x] Provisioning via **_Ansible_** for resources that need to be provisioned on an OS.
    *   [x] Orchestration via **_Helm + Helmsfile_** for resources that need to be provisioned in Kubernetes
        (with **_Docker_** as preferred container engine).
    *   [x] Infra as code deployments should run from the new `ID-XXX` or `master` branch. `ID-XXX` branch must be merged 
        immediately (ASAP) via PR to the `master` branch. 
           - :ledger: **Consideration:** validating that the changes within the code will only affect the desired target resources
            is the responsibility of the executor (to ensure everything is OK please consider exec after review/approved PR).
    *   [x] All resources will be deployed in several new AWS accounts created inside the Client AWS Organization. 
        Except for the AWS Legacy Account invitation to the AWS Org and _OrganizationAccountAccessRole_ creation in it, 
        there will be no intervention whatsoever in current Client Legacy Production account, unless required by Client 
        authority and given a specific requirement.

    We will explore the details of all the relevant Client application stacks, CI/CD processes, 
    monitoring, security, target service level objective (SLO) and others in a separate document.
