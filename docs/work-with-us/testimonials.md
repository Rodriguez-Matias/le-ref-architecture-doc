    Well-Architected Framework and Infrastructure as Code in an accelerated and efficient way without losing 
    compatibility with the tool's stardards we're using such as Terraform, Ansible and Helm. 
    The project planning and the work methodology helped us to strengthen our DevOps culture in the areas involved 
    such as loosely couple cloud architecture, development & CI/CD, monitoring, shift left on security and audit, 
    adding important cultural values such as collaboration, continuous improvement and knowledge transfer."*

    project for a US Digital Marketing customer and I have only good things to say about them. Good professionals and 
    also kind persons. They are those people you hope to have in all your projects. They are always there to give an
    efective response to the client, to suggest good practices, improvements with excellent communication skills. 
    When I needed them, they were always there to solve our issues and attend our requests. 
    Moreover, one of the Binbash Tech architected several of our project applications and also work along with their team
    in achieving continuous integration implementation and kick-off.Their sense of urgency and his ability to discover 
    potential risks are great, as well as finding the best way to solve problems when facing them.
    There is nothing bad I can say about these guys. I only wish someday to have the pleasure to work with them again."*
